This couse particularly to provide you with techniques and approaches for building better NLP chatbots and applicatoins. 

First thing first, to start with some basics. This will make sure you have a working chatbot. There are two steps to learning the basics. 

There are following major components to build a chatbot 
- intents, entities, contexts and webhooks. Learn all four, and you should be able to build a reasonably useful chatbot.
